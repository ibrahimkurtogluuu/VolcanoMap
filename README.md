# Interactive Volcano Map
## Overview
This project involves creating an interactive web map to display volcanic locations and their elevations. It utilizes two main technologies: HTML with JavaScript for web presentation and Python with the Folium library for map generation. The map showcases various volcanoes, dynamically colored based on their elevation.

## Features
Interactive Web Map: Displays volcanic data on a web map.
Dynamic Markers: Markers change color based on volcano elevation.
Popups on Click: Clickable markers that show the name of the volcano.
Leaflet Integration: Uses Leaflet.js for map rendering in the browser.
Python Data Processing: Python script to process data and create a map using Folium.
## How to Run
Web Map (HTML/JavaScript)
Ensure you have a modern web browser installed (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Open the provided HTML file in your browser to view the map.
Interact with the map to see volcano locations and details.
Folium Map (Python)
Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Install the required libraries: folium and pandas.
### Copy code
pip install folium pandas
Run the Python script to generate a new map.
The script will create an HTML file (test6.html), which you can open in a web browser to view the map.
## What I Learned
HTML and JavaScript for Web Maps: Learned to integrate Leaflet.js in HTML for interactive map creation.
Folium for Python Map Generation: Gained skills in using Folium to dynamically create maps based on data.
Data Processing with Pandas: Enhanced understanding of data manipulation using Pandas in Python.
Dynamic Styling Based on Data: Developed techniques for dynamically changing styles (marker colors) based on data attributes (elevation).
Integrating Python with Web Technologies: Understood how to combine Python backend scripts with frontend web technologies for interactive displays.
